#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Developing operating systems e.g. Windows, MacOS
2. Web applications e.g. Facebook , Google, Bing
3. Mobile apps e.g. Bolts, Uber and InDrive

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

*Waterfall
Simply put, Waterfall involves completing each project phase before moving on to the next. It emphasizes planning upfront the different phases of development, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

*Agile
Agile involves breaking a project into smaller, more manageable chunks and continuously iterating and improving upon them. Instead of following a predetermined plan, Agile emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between team members throughout the entire project cycle to accommodate change.

Waterfall vs Agile

Here are the advantages of each methodology, presented in separate points:

Advantages of Waterfall Methodology:

Clear and Defined Objectives: The Waterfall methodology is a linear approach that follows a sequential process. This means each project phase is completed before moving on to the next one. This approach provides clear objectives, making planning and managing the project easier.
Predictable Outcomes: Since the Waterfall methodology follows a sequential process, predicting the project’s outcome is easier. This makes estimating the time and resources required for each project phase easier.
Documentation: The Waterfall methodology requires detailed documentation, which makes it easier to maintain and update the project in the future. This documentation also helps ensure that the project meets the stakeholders’ requirements.

Advantages of Agile Methodology:

Adaptability: The Agile methodology is an iterative approach that allows flexibility and adaptability. The project can be adjusted based on stakeholder feedback or market changes.
Faster Time to Market: Since the Agile methodology is iterative, it allows for faster development and deployment of the project. This means the project can be delivered to the market faster, giving the organization an advantage.
Collaboration: The Agile methodology highlights the collaboration between the development team and the stakeholders. This collaboration helps to ensure that the project meets the needs of the stakeholders and that everyone is on the same page.
Let us delve into the major drawbacks of Waterfall methodology and Agile methodology, presented in separate points for clarity:

Disadvantages of Waterfall Methodology:

Firstly, The Waterfall methodology is a rigid approach that does not allow for changes or modifications once the project has begun. This lack of flexibility can lead to delays and increased costs if changes are required.
Second, High Risk: The Waterfall methodology is a high-risk approach as it relies on accurate planning and forecasting. If any assumptions made during the planning phase are incorrect, the entire project can be jeopardized. It is quite risky to conduct all the extensive testing once the project is almost done due to the temptation of rushing through it, especially when working with tight deadlines.
Thirdly, The Waterfall methodology does not prioritize customer involvement throughout the project. This can lead to a lack of understanding of the customer’s needs and requirements, resulting in a product that does not meet their expectations.
At last, it is time-consuming and can take months or even years to complete. This can be a disadvantage in today’s fast-paced business environment, where time-to-market is critical.
Disadvantages of Agile Methodology:

Firstly, Agile methodology can be challenging to implement in larger organizations. The flexibility and adaptability of Agile can lead to confusion and miscommunication among team members, particularly when working on complex projects.
Secondly, Agile methodology requires high collaboration and communication between team members. This can be difficult to achieve when team members are geographically dispersed or have conflicting schedules.
Thirdly, Agile methodology can result in a lack of documentation, which can be problematic for future reference or compliance purposes.
Lastly, Agile methodology can lead to scope creep, where the project’s scope expands beyond its original parameters. This can result in delays, increased costs, and a lack of focus on the project’s original goals.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  - System Architect: Designs the overall structure and architecture of software systems.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
