#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).
  - Testing Frameworks: Libraries and frameworks for automating the testing process and ensuring software quality (e.g., JUnit, Selenium, Jest).
Importance of Tools: Software engineering tools enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process, including:
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit/Component Testing
Unit testing is done at the code level, where each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality. Automating unit tests is possible and highly recommended in today’s fast-paced development environment. To make a unit test, you should outline what you expect the code to do and write the code, which will check if it is doing what you expect. You should then run the unit test to verify that everything works as expected. For example, let’s say you have a calculator program that adds two numbers together. You can create a unit test that verifies the numerical values that the calculator program returns are correct. You could also create tests that verify edge cases and errors are handled correctly.

In this simple example, you could use unit testing to verify that the calculator program adds two numbers correctly.

First, outline and document the expectations of the program, such as:

The program should accept two numerical values
It should return the sum of these two values
It should also handle negative numbers correctly
You can then write unit tests that feed these values into the program and verify the correct output. For example, you could have a test that checks the program returns 2 when 1 and 1 are entered. You could have another test that checks the program returns -3 when 1 and -4 are entered. Once all the tests have been written and executed, you can confidently say that the calculator program has been successfully tested and works as expected.

2. Integration Testing
Integration testing enables software testers to test group units integrated into a system or subsystems; it helps identify any bugs or issues arising from coding errors or integrations between modules. It is possible to automate integration testing.

3. System Testing
System testing is performed on an integrated environment comprising the whole application, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements. You can use automation tools for System Testing.

For example, Testsigma, a no-code test automation platform, can complete end-to-end flows for web, mobile, and desktop applications and APIs.

4. Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing involves testing the system’s Functional and Non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, usability, accessibility, compatibility, and reliability. Depending on the system’s complexity, it can be done manually or through automation tools. In this example, we will demonstrate the process of using Testsigma to automate the acceptance testing of a login page. First, we must create a test scenario that simulates users entering their login credentials and logging in successfully. Testsigma will automatically detect any issues with the page and report them back to us. Using Testsigma for acceptance testing, we can ensure that our login page is working as expected and ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts—questions or instructions—to elicit specific responses from AI models. Think of it as the interface between human intent and machine output. 
In the vast realm of AI, where models are trained on enormous datasets, the right prompt can be the difference between a model understanding your request or misinterpreting it.

For instance, if you've ever interacted with voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, you've engaged in a basic form of prompt engineering. The way you phrase your request—"Play some relaxing music" versus "Play Beethoven's Symphony"—can yield vastly different results.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Less Effective: “Give me a blog topic about food.”

More Effective: “I’m looking to write a blog post about unique vegan desserts from around the world. Can you provide a breakdown of five such desserts with their countries of origin and main ingredients?”

Explanation: The first prompt is too general. While it does ask for a topic about food, ChatGPT might come up with a wide range of suggestions, which might not align with what you had in mind. The revised prompt narrows down the request to a specific niche within food blogging (vegan desserts) and even provides a format for the desired output (a breakdown of five desserts).
